"my_dataset.prefetch(buffer_size=tf.data.experimental.AUTOTUNE)"
This allows later elements to be prepared while the current element is being processed. 
This often improves latency and throughput, at the cost of using additional memory to store prefetched elements.

"my_dataset.batch(batch_size)"
Combines consecutive elements of this dataset into batches.

"my_dataset.repeat(epochs)"
Repeats this dataset so each original value is seen count times.

"my_dataset.cache()"
Caches the elements in this dataset.
