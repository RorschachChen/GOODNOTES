DataFrame is a distributed collection of data organized into named columns. It is conceptually equivalent to a table in a relational database or a data
frame in R/Python, but with richer optimizations under the hood. DataFrames can be constructed from a wide array of sources such as structured data files, 
tables in Hive, external databases, or existing RDDs.
