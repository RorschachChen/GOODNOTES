836. Rectangle Overlap
Solution:
def isRectangleOverlap(self, rec1: List[int], rec2: List[int]) -> bool:
        left=rec2[0]<=rec1[0] and rec2[2]<=rec1[0]
        right=rec2[0]>=rec1[2] and rec2[2]>=rec1[2]
        
        ymin=min(rec1[1],rec1[3])
        ymax=max(rec1[1],rec1[3])
        
        up=rec2[1]>=ymax and rec2[3]>=ymax
        down=rec2[1]<=ymin and rec2[3]<=ymin

        if left or right or up or down: return False
        return True

543. Diameter of Binary Tree
Given a binary tree, you need to compute the length of the diameter of the tree. 
The diameter of a binary tree is the length of the longest path between any two nodes in a tree. 
This path may or may not pass through the root.
