torch.chunk(tensor, chunk_num, dim)与torch.cat()原理相反，它是将tensor按dim（行或列）分割成chunk_num个tensor块，返回的是一个元组。

torch.stack()
Concatenates sequence of tensors along a new dimension.

torch.t(input) → Tensor
转置
Expects input to be <= 2-D tensor and transposes dimensions 0 and 1.
0-D and 1-D tensors are returned as it is and 2-D tensor can be seen as a short-hand function for transpose(input, 0, 1).

import torch.nn.functional as F

F.normalize(input, dim=1)
