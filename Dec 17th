1266. Minimum Time Visiting All Points <<array>>
Given a list of points, find the time consumed to walk along the sequence. Horizontal, vertical and diagonal is the same time. 
Solution: find the max of the x_diff and y_diff, sum over.

1252. Cells with Odd Values in a Matrix <<array>>
Given n and m which are the dimensions of a matrix initialized by zeros and given an array indices where indices[i] = [ri, ci]. 
For each pair of [ri, ci] you have to increment all cells in row ri and column ci by 1.Return the number of cells with odd 
values in the matrix after applying the increment to all indices.
Not suitable for Python, need cell to store.

700. Search in a Binary Search Tree <<tree>>
Given the root node of a binary search tree (BST) and a value. You need to find the node in the BST that the node's value 
equals the given value. Return the subtree rooted with that node. If such node doesn't exist, you should return NULL.
Solution: just search.

589. N-ary Tree Preorder Traversal <<tree>>
Given an n-ary tree, return the preorder traversal of its nodes' values. Nary-Tree input serialization is represented
in their level order traversal, each group of children is separated by the null value (See examples).
Solution: 
Input: root = [1,null,3,2,4,null,5,6]不过好像和root是list无关，就是直接把root想象成tree结构就行了
(1)Decide if the node has value, otherwise recursively preorder the child, use list.extend to add all the child in a time.
extend() 函数用于在列表末尾一次性追加另一个序列中的多个值
(2)(iteratively)把root放进list中，把list中的值pop出，直到为空。每次pop出val的同时把children extend到stack中
