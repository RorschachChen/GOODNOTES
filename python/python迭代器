def __iter__(self)

Iterators are objects that can be iterated upon.
iterator object must implement two special methods, __iter__() and __next__(), collectively called the iterator protocol.

__next__()
We use the next() function to manually iterate through all the items of an iterator. 
When we reach the end and there is no more data to be returned, it will raise StopIteration.
调用iter()产生一个iterator
每次调用next()就产生一个元素

The __iter__() method returns the iterator object itself.
The __next__() method must return the next item in the sequence.
