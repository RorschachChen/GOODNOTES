804, Unique Morse Code Words
count the unique morse composition of all the given words.
len(), len() and use ord()-ord('a') to get the index for the morse table
1. add transformed word to set() and find the length of set
2. use {} and join to concatenate the char in word (there are no two or more same key in dict)
3. 

1, Two Sum
find the two indexes for which the sum of the two values are equal to the target
first check out if the pair is in the list, then check if the target is twice of the first value, 
if correct find out if there is another same value in the list, return.
else delete the first from the list, and continue until we find the pair and return.
Upgraded:
Don't use delete, otherwise requires a lot calculation about the index later. use enumurate to find the overall index.
Upgraded:
enumerate the list, calculate the difference between the target and the value, if not exist, put the index of value in another
dict, until find, return both of the index from dict.
